This will usually be in the form of a customer or dealer. For internal issues or task please use Asana. Zendesk primary functions are to.</p><ul>\n<li>Track new issues</li>\n<li>Gather and record history on issues</li>\n<li>Delegate tasks to the right individuals</li>\n<li>Provide stellar support to customers</li>\n</ul><p>For ZenDesk to be an effective tool, it important to agree upon standards and to follow them in a disciplined manner. This is as true for creating tickets as it is for responding to them</p></div><h3 id=\"fields\"><a class=\"toc-anchor nc-icon-outline location_bookmark-add internal-link\" href=\"#fields\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a> Fields</h3><div class=\"indent-h3\"><p><strong>Requester</strong><br>\nEvery Ticket should have a requestor, which usually the person who has the problem or inquiry. There are four kinds or users. Dealers, Representatives, online customers, Other. If they do not yet exist as a user it&apos;s is up to you to create a user profile for them.</p><p><strong>Assignee</strong><br>\nWho on the team should be seeing this? If you know feel free to enter their name. If uncertain, leave blank. Selecting the wrong team member for review interferes with work flow and can leave tickets unanswered.</p><p><strong>Subject</strong><br>\nWhen creating a new Zendesk ticket create a subject with a customer include Name - Subject. In case of a dealer it should be Name - Dealer - Subject.  Ex. Bryce - Huckleberry Bicycles -  Replacing a Rack</p><p><strong>Description</strong><br>\nThe description should be succinct but not fragmented. Describe the issue and gather any relevant history to problem. Always include a callback number or e-mail in the description. If if it a familiar dealer it&apos;s important to include a contact information with every ticket. For bike related issues include bike model and color. If it&#x2019;s a dealer calling about a bike please get the customer name and number!</p><p><strong>Priority</strong><br>\nWhen there is a backlog of ticket, setting priority is key for getting the pressing issues in time. It&#x2019;s good practice to set a priority when creating a new ticket. There are four levels:</p><ul>\n<li>Low - Requires attention within one business week</li>\n<li>Medium - Requires attention within 48 hours</li>\n<li>High - Requires attention with 24 hours</li>\n<li>Urgent - Requires same day attention</li>\n</ul><p>On an agent&apos;s ticket page, zendesk will automatically order tickets based on priority.</p><p><strong>Type</strong><br>\nType is another required field for every ticket. Type allows for the most general categorisation of issues. There are only four options to choose from. Questions, Incidents, Problems, or Tasks</p><p><strong>Form</strong><br>\nThere are three form types to selector from</p><ul>\n<li>Customer Ticket - This is a general purpose form and is good for answering inquiries</li>\n<li>Warranty - This form should only be used if parts need to be replaced for warranty</li>\n<li>RMA - This form should be used if the bike is coming back for repair, replacement or refund</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Tags</strong><br>\nTags are awesome. They keep tickets organised and readable. When creating a new ticket it&#x2019;s helpful for the assignee to have them for quick reference.  For general use, you can use any of the following tags:</p><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Tag</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>battery_testing</td>\n<td>Getting a battery back to be tested in house</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>dead_selector</td>\n<td>Selectors that have no function</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>bled_bug</td>\n<td>Blue LED Bug</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ghost_power</td>\n<td>Bike turns on by itself</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pedal_assist</td>\n<td>Bike is not providing assist</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>front_rack_weld</td>\n<td>Broken weld</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sleeping_battery</td>\n<td>Battery was left to die</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>braking_facing</td>\n<td>Braking were difficult to align on new build</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>broken_seatpost</td>\n<td>2014 seat posts that snap</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>shipping_damage</td>\n<td>Tracking FedEx issues</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>user_error</td>\n<td>Something was damaged by user/shop</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>arc</td>\n<td>The charger or charger port arcs/burns/melts</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div><h3 id=\"responding-to-tickets\"><a class=\"toc-anchor nc-icon-outline location_bookmark-add internal-link\" href=\"#responding-to-tickets\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a> Responding to Tickets</h3><div class=\"indent-h3\"><p>Tickets can be in four statuses:</p><ol>\n<li>New - This ticket may have been assigned internally but no effort has yet been made to resolve the issue</li>\n<li>Open - Work in progress - It requires attention and action to be taken by Faraday</li>\n<li>Pending - Pending should only used when further action from the the requestor is required.</li>\n<li>Solved - This is resolved issue. It can be viewed for reference but a new issue should involve creating a new ticket</li>\n</ol><p>Zendesk sorts tickets by status allowing you to quickly navigate to pending or open tickets. Like reaching inbox zero, the objective is to solve all tickets as quickly as possible</p></div></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</body></html>","meta":{"title":"Support Services","subtitle":"A quick summary of Support Services","path":"support--services"},"tree":[{"content":"Header","anchor":"header","nodes":[{"content":"Zendesk Support","anchor":"zendesk-support","nodes":[]}]}],"parent":false}
